# Fantasy-Football
Find the most optimal fantasy football draft strategy based on data from the 2012-2019 NFL fantasy seasons. 

The project was started out by looking at two different websites;
https://fantasyfootballcalculator.com/adp/standard/12-team/all/2019 which was used for getting a baseline of where each player was selected in a fantasy football draft on average. The type of draft in Standard (Non-PPR) and assuming 12 players participating in the league. The link shows the 2019 year, but this year and all years down to 2012 were used for the project. 
https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/reports/leaders/?year=2019&start=1&end=17 this website was used to gather the fantasy points that each player received for the respected season they played in. Once again the link shows the 2019 year, where this and all years down to 2012 were used for the data. 

After the data has been collected, the raw data was placed into a Jupyter file and using Python I rearranged the data to fit the proper outputs needed to make inferences.
Once the data was cleaned and set into proper formats, I made visuals out of it using Tableau.

An article to see the data and inferences about the results can be found here https://www.mattsmit.com/post/fantasy-football-draft-strategy-optimal-team-layout
